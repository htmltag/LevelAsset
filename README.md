# LevelAsset

This is a simple asset management system written in Go, using LevelDB as the storage backend and Gin for the HTTP server.

The system is designed to be used as a simple key-value store, with the ability to store and retrieve assets by their keys.
As long as the asset is a valid JSON object, it can be stored in the system.
